            <h2>Top 10 Recycling Tips</h2>
            <p>Learn the best ways to reduce waste and recycle effectively in your daily life.
                <br>
<a> Know Your Local Recycling Rules
                🏡 Different cities have different recycling guidelines. Check your local waste management website to learn what materials are accepted.
</a><br>
<a>Clean & Dry Before Recycling
    🚰 Rinse out food and drink containers before recycling them. Wet or dirty items can contaminate an entire batch.
</a><br>
                <a> Avoid "Wishcycling"
                    ❌ Just because something looks recyclable doesn’t mean it is. Throwing non-recyclables in the bin can cause processing issues.
                </a><br>
                <a>         Separate Properly
                    🔄 Many recycling programs require separation of materials like paper, plastic, and glass. Follow the guidelines to ensure efficient recycling.
                </a>
             <a>      Skip the Plastic Bags
                    🛍️ Don’t put recyclables in plastic bags—they can clog sorting machines. Instead, place items loosely in the bin.
                </a>
             <a>         Flatten Cardboard Boxes
                    📦 Break down boxes before recycling to save space and improve processing efficiency.
                </a>
             <a>      Recycle Electronics Responsibly
                    💻 Many electronics (phones, batteries, laptops) require special disposal. Take them to designated e-waste recycling centers.
                </a>
              <a>     Compost Organic Waste
                    🌱 Food scraps, coffee grounds, and yard waste can be composted instead of thrown in the trash, reducing landfill waste.
                </a>
               <a>   Reduce & Reuse First
                    🔄 Before recycling, try to reduce waste by using reusable bags, bottles, and containers. Reusing items extends their life and saves resources.
                </a>
              <a>      Support Recycled Products
                    🛒 Buy products made from recycled materials—like notebooks, clothing, and packaging—to support the recycling industry.
