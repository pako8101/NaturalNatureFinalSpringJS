                    <h4>Infrastructure for Pedestrians</h4>
                    <p>
                        Urban design now prioritizes pedestrians with wider sidewalks, more crosswalks, and green spaces. In 2025, Barcelona’s “Superblocks” initiative, which restricts car access in certain areas, has lowered noise pollution by 12 decibels and improved air quality by 25%. Shaded walkways and pedestrian bridges, like those in Singapore, make walking viable even in hot climates.

                    <h4>Technological Solutions for Safety</h4>
                    <p>
                        By 2025, pedestrian safety has improved through technology. Smart crosswalks with embedded sensors and LED lights, like those in Seoul, alert drivers to pedestrians, reducing accidents by 40%. Autonomous vehicles are now programmed to prioritize pedestrian safety, with 2024 EU regulations mandating advanced pedestrian detection systems in all new cars.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Policy and Urban Planning</h4>
                    <p>
                        Cities are adopting “Vision Zero” policies to eliminate pedestrian fatalities. Stockholm, a pioneer, has reduced pedestrian deaths to near zero by 2025 through lower speed limits (30 km/h in urban areas) and traffic calming measures like speed bumps. Community-led initiatives, such as school walking buses, also promote safe walking for children.

                    <h4>Health Benefits of Walking</h4>
                    <p>
                        Walking is the simplest form of sustainable transport, with profound health benefits. A 2025 study by the American Heart Association found that walking 30 minutes daily reduces the risk of diabetes by 35%. It also improves mental health—cities with high walkability, like Vancouver, report 20% lower rates of depression among residents.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Cultural Shift Towards Walking</h4>
                    <p>
                        Walking has become a cultural movement by 2025, with initiatives like “Walk to Work Days” gaining popularity. Wearable tech, such as Fitbit’s 2024 smart shoes, tracks steps and encourages daily walking goals. In Japan, “forest bathing” walks in urban parks have surged, blending sustainability with wellness and reducing urban stress.
